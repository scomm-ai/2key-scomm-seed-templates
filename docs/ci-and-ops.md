# Platform ops (internal)

**Audience: us.** They fork/fill/PR ([README](../README.md), [recipes](recipes.md)). VM mapping: [stand-up.md](stand-up.md).

**Our job:** on `catalog-seed-updated` for **this** `catalog_repo`, apply that SHA on the **Scomm VM**. We do not own their catalog git.

Canonical `2keyapp/2key-seed-templates` does not dispatch.

## What their CI does

`.github/workflows/catalog-seed.yml`:

1. **Every PR and push** — `npm ci && npm run validate`.
2. **Push to `main`** — `repository_dispatch` `catalog-seed-updated`:

   ```json
   {
     "event_type": "catalog-seed-updated",
     "client_payload": {
       "sha": "<commit>",
       "ref": "<git ref>",
       "catalog_repo": "<github owner/name of this fork>"
     }
   }
   ```

Apply that payload **only** on the Scomm VM.

## Secrets (we set on this fork)

| Name | Type | Value |
|------|------|--------|
| `DOWNSTREAM_DISPATCH_TOKEN` | Repository **secret** | Token that can `POST /repos/<ops>/dispatches` |
| `DOWNSTREAM_REPO` | Actions **variable** | Our ops repo `owner/name` |

Until the handler is live, apply that SHA by hand on the **Scomm** VM — still their JSON.

## Apply (the only seed task on the VM)

```bash
# this checkout @ the dispatched sha, Scomm billing .env
billing-seed validate --dir .
billing-seed apply --dir .
```

`auth.json` is used when the file exists. Apply updates Postgres. Apps consume their committed `hosts.json`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|----------------|
| `npm run validate` extra property | Typo or a field not in format v1. Help them on **their** PR. |
| Apply unknown offering | `offeringCodes` is not a key on `Scomm` offerings. Help them on **their** PR. |
| Apply unknown currency | USD not enabled on **this** VM. |
| Apply refuses to drop a SKU | They deleted a live key. `"isActive": false`. |
| Dispatch skipped | Canonical template, or the event is a pull_request. |
| Shop empty / wrong SKUs | Not applied yet, or applied to the wrong VM. |

## Catalog format updates

Do not hand-edit `schemas/`. From **billing**: `npm run catalog-seed:schema`, then they pull schema updates into **this** fork (we help).
